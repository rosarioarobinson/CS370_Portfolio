# Current/Emerging Trends in CS Portfolio for CS 370

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

This project focused on understanding the concepts and aspects of artificial intelligence and its implementation within neural networks. Throughout this course, I was able to create code that allowed me to showcase my understanding of how neural networks work and how important of a role they play within machine learning, which falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence.

During this project, I was provided starter code in the form of two Python files and a Jupyter Notebook file. TreasureMaze.py focused on being a class that represented the environment of the project, which was a maze, and the directions the agent was allowed to go. Next is GameExperience.py, which focused on another class that represented the maze’s episodes, which will be connected to the neural networks I must create. Lastly, we have the TreasureHuntGame jupyter file, which focuses on the agent learning to play through the maze itself.

I had to create and complete the deep Q-learning implementation for the jupyter file, which consists of creating an algorithm that would find the best possible navigation sequence to achieve a 100% win rate with an optimal number of epochs. Within my code, I had to initialize the environment, randomly choose a direction, attempt to go through the maze, and store the episodes while also training the neural network to create and evaluate the losses. My code helped complete the process required of the neural network and state how long it took for the network to learn to successfully navigate through the entire maze.

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

The question of what computer scientists do can vary, especially if they lean towards engineering or research. However, overall, I would state that computer scientists help propel the state of technology further through the study and application of software, systems, and technology. The work they do is important in the current age of technology, especially since technology and fields like artificial intelligence have come so far over the last 20 years alone. To connect this to the work that I learned within this course, machine learning is still a relatively newer field in comparison to others, especially with the current understanding of how far artificial intelligence can go within society. A computer scientist’s job is to take their current knowledge of this field and continue to learn and experiment with the current technology and software available to better improve society as a whole.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

The ways that I was a computer scientist approach a problem lies in the methods I have been taught and adapted to help solve said problem. For instance, within this course, there was a lot of information provided that I found to be overwhelming and hard to interpret at times. Even for the projects, what I noticed I had to do to prevent myself from becoming too overwhelmed was to break down larger problems and make them into smaller problems. By doing so, I can focus on each requirement necessary and take it one at a time until the project is running properly and completed.
I also believe that as a computer scientist, aspects of documentation are important to keep in mind. This includes code comments within my projects as well as READMEs when uploading files to GitHub. Approaching problems like a computer scientist in the best ways possible allows me to find the best solution possible that is beneficial for the client or company I am working for.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

When it comes to ethics, it is important to be as transparent as possible to the end-user and the organization. As a computer scientist and developer, it is my job to keep in my if any of my algorithms and overall code are biased towards any person or group. Keeping up to date with ethical concepts such as Responsible Research and Innovation and Ethics by Design will help to prevent any biases or otherwise within my code. Many companies, especially ones relating to artificial intelligence have discussed methods and ways to prevent biases and breaches of ethics to creep into one's code or even business models. All of these aspects as a developer must be kept in mind to ensure not only the end-user is protected, but the organization itself is as well.
